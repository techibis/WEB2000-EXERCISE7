		<h1>Bocaditos de Helado</h1>

		<p>
		You mean you haven’t heard of Tio Colo’s Bocaditos de Helado?!? Really, neither had I but they have been more than 4 years. Tucked away in a busy shopping center, “entre los dos maniqui” as one employee told me they serve up the same Cuban Ice Cream treats they did when they lived in their motherland.
		</p><p>
		I walked into this simple space on a hot Sunday afternoon and felt like I had just walked off the beach. It was quiet, inviting and just cool enough to make you forget it’s 100 plus degrees out.

		The basic way a Bocadito de Helado differs from an American Ice Cream Sandwich is the “Bread”. These Bocaditos de Helado are sandwiched between two spongy, sweet, almost crispy pieces of homemade Yellow Cake. They are crispy because of the Sugar they are coated in, just plain Sugar but it makes such an impact. Also, it’s worth noting that the folks at Tio Colo’s are serious about their Ice Cream; to the point, that part of the Ice Cream process happens right there on their premises.
